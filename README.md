# 1. Interfaces vs. Types & `keyof` Keyword

TypeScript helps developers write safer and more maintainable code. WWeâ€™ll explain the difference between **interfaces** and **types** in this blog.

---

## 1. **Interfaces vs. Types**

**interfaces** and **types** define the shape of data but they have key differences.

### **Interfaces**

- It used mainly to describe object shapes.
- It can be merged.

### **Types**

- It's more flexible. It can define objects, unions and intersections.
- It's better for complex data shapes.

### **Key Differences**

- **Interfaces** can be extended and merged while **types** are more flexible.
- **Interfaces** are usually better for objects while **types** are useful for combining types and complex data structures.

## 2. **The `keyof` Keyword**

The **`keyof`** keyword creates a type that represents the keys of an object.

### **How `keyof` Works**

- It helps you safely access object keys, ensuring you only use valid keys.
- This prevents errors when working with object properties.

## Conclusion

It is use **interfaces** for simple object shapes and **types** for complex scenarios. The **`keyof`** keyword helps make your code safer by only allowing valid object keys. These tools help you write more reliable and maintainable TypeScript code.



## 2. How TypeScript Improves Code Quality

TypeScript makes your code safer and easier to manage. It helps by -

- Catching errors before running the code  
- Making code easier to read with clear types  
- Providing better autocomplete and suggestions  
- Making refactoring safer  
- Helping large projects stay organized

TypeScript helps you write cleaner and more reliable code.
